# SobczyksScheduler

This is a workday scheduler that allows users to select a time block, edit the contents, and save it to local storage. If the page is refreshed, the time block entry will fill out from local storage and the entries will persist on reload.

The top of the page displays the current day. The time blocks are also color coordinated and will auto update depending on the time of day when the page is loaded.

Grey block : in the past.

Red block: current hour.

Green block: in the future.

This page was written using Jquery, Moment.js, and Bootstrap.
